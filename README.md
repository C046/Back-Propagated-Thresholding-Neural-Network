A custom neural network legitmately.

I implemented backpropagted thresholding for the sigmoid function using the chain rule in mathamatics and the binary cross entropy function.
Using the chain rule I was able to establish a minimum with 9.99/1.0 % accuracy within 2 epochs and vary few hidden layers.
